When the process goes out of the scope, the process object waits for the child
process to finish before destructing.

1. Yes, it's good use of object-oriented design. 

2. I would not modify anything. To change the destructor, I would let the 
   programmer extend Process class and create his/her own virtual destructor.

3. The child could notify the parent in its destructor somehow.
